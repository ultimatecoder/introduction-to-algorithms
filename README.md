# Solutions - Introduction to Algorithms üéâ

![Introduction to Algorithm](assets/images/introduction_to_algorithms.jpg)


## Description

This repository is the collection of programs which are either solutions to a
problem or example pseudocode at [the Introduction to Algorithm
book][introduction_to_algorithm]. These programs are written in [Python][python]
programming language.

### Dependencies ‚öíÔ∏è

* [PDFLaTeX][pdflatex]


### Commands üì¶

```
make build
```
This command will prepare a build of solutions and code examples at `output`
directory of your project. This command collectively fires all sub build command
of each individual category.

```
make build-solutions
```

This command will build a solutions in PDF format. As a result of this command,
`output/solutions.pdf` file is generated which is a solutions of this commands.
